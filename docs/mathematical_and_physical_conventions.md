## On the use of curvilinear coordinates

Let us consider a system of coordinates denoted by $`\{q^i\}_{ i \in [1, N]}`$, where $`i`$ is an integer quantity and $`N`$ is the dimension of the space mapped by the $`\{q^i\}`$ coordinates. For the sake of simplicity we use in the following the compact $`\{q^i\}`$ notation to denote the set $`\{q^i\}_{ i \in [1, N]}`$. The $`\{q^i\}`$ coordinate system can be derived from Cartesian coordinates---that we denote by $`\{x^i\}`$--- from the invertible transformation

```math
q^i = q^i(x^1, \ldots , x^N) \quad \forall i \in [1, N].
```

Note that even though an inverse of the functions $`q^i(x^1, \ldots , x^N)`$ must exist so that the coordinate transform is valid, it is not always possible to write an explicit formula for such inverse. The surface defined by $`q^i = \text{constant}`$ is called a *coordinate surface*, the intersection of these surfaces define *coordinate curves*. A *coordinate axis* is locally defined as the axis tangent to a given coordinate curve. As their name suggests, coordinate curves do not form straight lines in general. An illustration for these geometrical concepts is given in the following figure.

![Coordinate curves, surfaces and axes in a three-dimensional space](./curvilinear_coordinates_def.png "")

The position of any point in space can be written as

```math
\overrightarrow{r} = x^i \mathbf{e}_i,
```

where we introduced the unit vectors of the orthonormal Cartesian basis $`\{\mathbf{e}_i\}`$. The position vector $`\overrightarrow{r}`$ is not to be confused with the radial coordinate $`r`$. We rely on the Einstein summation in the above equation and in the following, i.e. we consider that repeated indices indicate a summation. See the [wikipedia page on Einstein summation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation) for more details.

## Contravariant and covariant bases

Let us define the *contravariant basis* $`\{\mathbf{b}_i\}`$ associated to the $`\{q^i\}`$ coordinates by

```math
\mathbf{b}_i = \frac{\partial \overrightarrow{r}}{\partial q^i} = \frac{\partial x^j}{\partial q^i} \mathbf{e}_j,
```

and its dual basis, the *covariant basis* $`\{\mathbf{b}^i\}`$ by

```math
\mathbf{b}^i = \nabla q^i = \frac{\partial q^i}{\partial x^j} \mathbf{e}_j.
```

These two bases are *local bases*, in the sense that the $`\mathbf{b}_i`$ and $`\mathbf{b}^i`$ vectors depend on the considered position in space, i.e.
we have $`\mathbf{b}_i(x^1, \ldots , x^N)`$ and $`\mathbf{b}^i(x^1, \ldots , x^N)`$. A geometrical interpretation of these two bases reads as follows. The *covariant* unit vector $`\mathbf{b}^i`$ is orthogonal to the coordinate surface $`q^i = \text{constant}`$, while the *contravariant* unit vector $`\mathbf{b}_i`$ is locally tangent to the coordinate curve associated with the $`q^i`$ coordinate. This is the situation depicted in the following picture.

![Geometrical interpretation of the contravariant and covariant bases vectors](./curvilinear_coordinates_contravariant_covariant_bases.png)

Note that neither contravariant nor covariant bases form orthonormal vector sets in general. Additionally note that in the case of Cartesian coordinates covariant and contravariant bases are the same. In general, the following property holds

```math
\mathbf{b}^i \cdot \mathbf{b}_j = \delta_{ij}, 
```

with $`\cdot`$ the dot product operator and the Kronecker delta $`\delta_{ij} = 1`$ if $`i= j`$, and $`\delta_{ij} = 0`$ otherwise. Let us now consider a vector $`\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^N`$. This vector may be expressed in either covariant or contravariant bases as

```math
\mathbf{A} = A_i \mathbf{b}^i = A^i \mathbf{b}_i, 
```

Where

- $`\{A_i\}`$ are the components of $`\mathbf{A}`$ in *the covariant basis*. We call these *the covariant components* of $`\mathbf{A}`$;
- $`\{A^i\}`$ are the components of $`\mathbf{A}`$ in *the contravariant basis*. We call these *the contravariant components* of $`\mathbf{A}`$;

## Metric tensor

The *metric tensor* $`G`$ associated with the set of coordinates $`\{q^i\}`$ is defined from its components $`g_{ij}`$ as

```math
g_{ij} = \mathbf{b}_i \cdot \mathbf{b}_j,
```

and the *inverse metric tensor* $`G^{-1}`$, whose components are written as $`g^{ij}`$, is defined as

```math
g^{ij} = \mathbf{b}^i \cdot \mathbf{b}^j.
```

A property of the metric tensor is that it can be used to transform contravariant components of a vector into covariant components and conversely, as

```math
\begin{aligned}
A_i =& g_{ij}A^j, \\
A^i =& g^{ij}A_j.
\end{aligned}
```

An easy way to get the above formulas right is to remember that the metric tensor can be used to "raise" or "lower" indices.

## Jacobian

### Curvilinear to Cartesian

The *Jacobian* matrix $`J`$ associated with the transformation from the curvilinear coordinates $`\{q^i\}`$ to the Cartesian coordinates $`\{x^i\}`$ is defined from its components $`J\left.^{i}_{\;j}\right.`$ as

```math
J\left.^{i}_{\;j}\right. = \frac{\partial x^i}{\partial q^j},
```

while the inverse Jacobian $`J^{-1}`$ is defined by its components $`J^{-1}\left.^{i}_{\;j}\right.`$ as

```math
J^{-1}\left.^{i}_{\;j}\right. = \frac{\partial q^i}{\partial x^j}.
```

Both Jacobian and metric tensor relate to each other as

```math
G = J^{T}J.
```

The Jacobian of a curvilinear coordinate transformation can be used to relate the components of a vector expressed in the Cartesian basis $`\{\mathbf{e}_i\}`$ to the components of the vector expressed in the contravariant basis $`\{\mathbf{b}_i\}`$ associated with the curvilinear coordinate system. More precisely, let us write a vector $`\mathbf{A}`$ as

```math
\mathbf{A} = A^i_\text{c} \mathbf{e}_i = A^i \mathbf{b}_i, 
```

Where the "c" subscript indicates that the considered components is computed in the Cartesian basis. Note that we used the contravariant basis in the expression above. It can be shown using the chain rule that the following equality holds

```math
A^i_\text{c} = J\left.^{i}_{\;j}\right. A^j. 
```

Note that relating the components of the vector $`\mathbf{A}`$ expressed in the covariant basis is less straightforward as this involves the metric tensor, i.e.  

```math
A^i_\text{c} = J\left.^{i}_{\;j}\right. g^{jk}A_k. 
```

### Curvilinear to curvilinear

Let us now consider the more general case where one seeks to relate two curvilinear coordinate systems $`\{q^i\}`$ and $`\{p^i\}`$. We denote by $`J\{q\to p\}`$ the Jacobian of the transformation from the coordinate system $`\{q^i\}`$ to $`\{p^i\}`$. The components of the Jacobian and of its inverse are defined similarly as above as

```math
J\left.^{i}_{\;j}\right.\{q\to p\} = \frac{\partial p^i}{\partial q^j}, \quad J^{-1}\left.^{i}_{\;j}\right.\{p\to q\} = \frac{\partial q^i}{\partial p^j}. 
```

Here one may note that $`J^{-1}\left.^{i}_{\;j}\right.\{p\to q\} = J\left.^{i}_{\;j}\right.\{q\to p\}`$. Let us now write $`\{\mathbf{b}_i\}`$ (resp. $`\{\mathbf{b}^i\}`$) the contravariant (resp. covariant) vector basis associated with coordinates $`\{q^i\}`$, and $`\{\mathbf{c}_i\}`$ (resp. $`\{\mathbf{c}^i\}`$) the contravariant (resp. covariant) vector basis associated with coordinates $`\{p^i\}`$. Let us now express a vector $`\mathbf{A}`$ in these bases as

```math
\mathbf{A} = A^i\{p\} \mathbf{b}_i = A_i\{p\} \mathbf{b}^i = A^i\{q\} \mathbf{c}_i = A_i\{q\} \mathbf{c}^i, 
```

where $`A^i\{p\}`$ (resp. $`A_i\{p\}`$) refers to the $`i`$-th contravariant (resp. covariant) component of $`\mathbf{A}`$ expressed in the vector basis associated with coordinates $`\{p^i\}`$, and similarly $`A^i\{q\}`$ (resp. $`A_i\{q\}`$) refers to the $`i`$-th contravariant (resp. covariant) component of $`\mathbf{A}`$ expressed in the vector basis associated with coordinates $`\{q^i\}`$. We have

```math
A^i\{p\} = J\left.^{i}_{\;j}\right.\{q\to p\} A^j\{q\}. 
```

By introducing the metric tensors $`G\{p\}`$  and $`G\{q\}`$ associated with both curvilinear coordinates system, and by writing $`g_{ij}\{p\}`$ and $`g_{ij}\{q\}`$ their elements ($`g^{ij}\{p\}`$ and $`g^{ij}\{q\}`$ the elements of their inverse) one relates the components of $`\mathbf{A}`$ expressed in covariant vector basis associated with both curvilinear coordinates system as

```math
g^{ik}\{p\}A_k\{p\} = J\left.^{i}_{\;j}\right.\{q\to p\}g^{jl}\{p\} A_l\{q\}. 
```

## Differential operators

Hereafter are expressed differential operators in a curvilinear coordinate system $`\{q^i\}`$.

### Gradient

Let us consider a scalar field $`f`$. The gradient $`\nabla f`$ of such field is defined in the Cartesian basis $`\{\mathbf{e}_i\}`$ as

```math
\nabla f = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i} \mathbf{e}_i. 
```

This quantity can be expressed in the both covariant $`\{\mathbf{b}^i\}`$ and contravariant $`\{\mathbf{b}_i\}`$  vector basis as

```math
\nabla f = \frac{\partial f}{\partial q^i} \mathbf{b}^i = g^{ij} \frac{\partial f}{\partial q^j} \mathbf{b}_i. 
```

Note that the definition that uses the contravariant basis $`\{\mathbf{b}_i\}`$ is much more common.
