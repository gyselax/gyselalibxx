# Multipatch geometry tests

This folder contains sub-folders to group tests for operators that only work on multipatch geometries. The folders are:

- connectivity : Contains tests of operators and tags which describe how patches are connected.
- [geometries](./geometries/README.md) : Contains geometries that can be used in other folders to test functionalities.
- spline : Contains tests of multipatch spline operators.
