# Gyselalib++ tests

The `tests` folder contains the tests of the different elements implemented in the `src` folder.
It is broken up into the following sub-folders:

- [advection](./advection/README.md) - Tests on the advection operators made for templated dimensions.
- data type - Tests for the templated data types.
- geometry5D - Tests in the 5D geometry.
- [geometryRTheta](./geometryRTheta/README.md) - Tests in the polar geometry.
- geometryVparMu - Tests in the vpar-mu geometry.
- geometryXVx - Tests in the x-vx geometry.
- geometryXYVxVy - Tests in the x,y-vx,vy geometry.
- math\_tools - Test for mathematical functions.
- MPI parallelism - Tests for the templated MPI operators.
- [multipatch](./multipatch/README.md) - Tests for the classes that work over multipatch geometries.
- PDE solvers - Tests for the templated Partial Differential Equation solvers.
- quadrature - Tests for the templated quadrature operators.
- timesteppers - Tests for the templated time stepping operators.
- utils - Tests for general utilities.
