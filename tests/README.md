# Gyselalib++ tests

The `tests` folder contains the tests of the different elements implemented in the `src` folder. 
It is broken up into the following sub-folders:

 - [advection](./advection/README.md) - Tests on the advection operators made for templated dimensions. 
 - [collisions](./geometry5D/collisions/README.md) - Tests of the collision operator in the 5D geometry.
 - [geometryRTheta](./geometryRTheta/README.md) - Tests in the polar geometry.
