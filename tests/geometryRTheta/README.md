# Tests : Geometry (r, theta)

The `tests/geometryRTheta` folder contains all the code describing methods which are specific to a 2D curvilinear geometry containing a singular point. It is broken up into the following sub-folders:

- [advection\_2d\_rtheta](./advection_2d_rtheta/README.md) - Tests for the advection operator and time integration methods used on 2D polar domain. 

- [2d\_spline\_interpolator](./2d_spline_interpolator/README.md) - Tests for the interpolator on 2D polar domain. 

- [polar\_poisson](./polar_poisson/README.md) - Tests for the Poisson solver on 2D polar domain.
