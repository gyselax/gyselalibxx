# Geometry (r, theta)

The `geometryRTheta` folder contains all the code describing methods which are specific to a 2D curvilinear geometry containing a singular point. It is broken up into the following sub-folders:

- [advection](./advection/README.md) - Code describing advection operator and time integration methods used on 2D polar domain.

- [advection\_field](./advection_field/README.md) - Code describing computation of the advection field given to the advection operator. 

- [geometry](./geometry/README.md) - All the dimension tags used for a gyrokinetic semi-Lagrangian simulation in a curvilinear geometry.

- [initialization](./initialization/README.md) - Initializes the simulations on a 2D polar domain. 

- [interpolation](./interpolation/README.md) - Code describing interpolation methods on 2D polar domain. 

- [poisson](./poisson/README.md) - Code describing the polar Quasi-Neutrality solver.

- [time\_solver](./time_solver/README.md) - The methods to solve in time the equations system.
