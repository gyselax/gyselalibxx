# Geometry (r, theta)

The `geometryRTheta` folder contains all the code describing methods which are specific to a 2D curvilinear geometry containing a singular point. It is broken up into the following sub-folders:

- [advection](./advection/README.md) - Code describing advection operator and time integration methods used on 2D polar domain.

<!-- - [geometry](./geometry/README.md)  --> - All the dimension tags used for a gyrokinetic semi-Lagrangian simulation in a curvilinear geoemtry.

- [interpolation](./interpolation/README.md) - Code describing interpolation methods on 2D polar domain. 

<!-- - [poisson](./poisson/README.md) --> - Code describing the polar Poisson solver.
