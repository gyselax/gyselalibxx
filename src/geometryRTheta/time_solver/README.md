# Predictor-corrector methods

This folder contains different predictor-corrector methods: 
- Predictor-corrector: BslPredCorrRP; 
- Second order explicit predictor-corrector: BslExplicitPredCorrRP; 
- Second order implicit predictor-corrector: BslImplicitPredCorrRP; 

The second order explicit predictor-corrector and the second order implicit predictor-corrector are detailed in Edoardo Zoni's article [1]. 


The studied equations system is Vlasov-Poisson equations

```math
 L\phi = - \nabla \cdot (\alpha \nabla \phi) + \beta \phi = \rho,
\\ E = - \nabla \phi, 
\\ (A_x, A_y) = (-E_y, E_x), 
\\ \partial_t \rho + A_x \partial_x \rho +  A_y \partial_y \rho = 0,
\\ \rho(t = 0, r, \theta) = \rho_0(r,\theta).
```


Let's write $`\{t^n\}_n \text{ the time discretization, and } f^n = f(t^n, \cdot, \cdot)`$. 

 

## Predictor-corrector

This method is a Runge-Kutta 2 method: for $n\geq 0$, 

Advect on a half time step: 

 1. From $\rho^n$, we compute $\phi^n$ with the Poisson equation (IPoissonSolver); 
 
 2. From $\phi^n$, we compute $E^n$ by deriving (IPoissonSolver); 
 
 3. From $\rho^n \text{ and } A^n$, we compute $\rho^{n+1/2}$ by advecting (IAdvectionRP) on $\frac{dt}{2}$ with one of the selected time integration methods (ITimeStepper);
 
Advect on a full time step:  

 4. From $\rho^{n+1/2}$, we compute $\phi^{n+1/2}$ with the Poisson equation (IPoissonSolver); 
 
 5. From $\phi^{n+1/2}$, we compute $E^{n+1/2}$ by deriving (IPoissonSolver); 
 
 6. From $\rho^n \text{ and } A^{n+1/2}$, we compute $\rho^{n+1}$ by advecting (IAdvectionRP) on $dt$ with one of the selected time integration methods (ITimeStepper).


## Explicit predictor-corrector

This method is a second order explicit predictor-corrector: for $n\geq 0$, 

Prediction: 

 1. From $\rho^n$, we compute $\phi^n$ with the Poisson equation (IPoissonSolver); 
 
 2. From $\phi^n$, we compute $E^n$ by deriving (IPoissonSolver); 
 
 3. From $\rho^n \text{ and } A^n$, we compute $\rho^P$ by advecting (IAdvectionRP) on $dt$; 
 	- We write $X^P$ the characteristic feet such that $`\partial_t X^P = A^n(X^n)`$. 

Correction: 

 4. From $\rho^{P}$, we compute $\phi^{P}$ with the Poisson equation (IPoissonSolver); 
 
 5. From $\phi^{P}$, we compute $E^{P}$ by deriving (IPoissonSolver); 
 
 6. From $\rho^n \text{ and } \frac{A^{P}(X^n) + A^n(X^P)}{2}$, we compute $\rho^{C} = \rho^{n+1}$ by advecting (IAdvectionRP) on $dt$.
 


## Implicit predictor-corrector


This method is a second order implicit predictor-corrector: for $n\geq 0$, 

Prediction: 

 1. From $\rho^n$, we compute $\phi^n$ with the Poisson equation (IPoissonSolver); 
 
 2. From $\phi^n$, we compute $E^n$ by deriving (IPoissonSolver); 
 
 3. From $\rho^n \text{ and } A^n$, we compute $\rho^P$ by advecting (IAdvectionRP) on $\frac{dt}{2}$; 
 	- We write $X^P$ the characteristic feet such that it is the result of the implicit method:
```math
\partial_t X^k = \frac{A^n(X^n) + A^n(X^{k-1})}{2},  \qquad  X^k = X^n - \frac{dt}{2} \partial_t X^k.
```
