# Advection operator

## Studied equation 

The studied equation is the following 2D transport equation type : 
```math
\partial_t f(t,x,y) + A(t,x,y)\cdot\nabla f(t,x,y) = 0,
```

with $`f(0,x,y) = f_0(x,y)`$ and *A* the advection field. 

**We want to solve it on a polar grid so we have:**  $`(t,x,y) = (t,x(r,\theta),y(r,\theta))`$. 

## Backward Semi-Lagrangian method

The method used to solve the equation is a Backward Semi-Lagrangian method (BSL). 
It uses the conservation along the characteristics property: 
```math
\forall t, \quad f(t, x, y) = f(s, X(t; s, x, y), Y(t; s, x, y))
```

with:
```math
\partial_t X (t; s, x, y) = A_x(t,X(t; s, x, y),Y(t; s, x, y)),\\
\partial_t Y (t; s, x, y) = A_y(t,X(t; s, x, y),Y(t; s, x, y)),\\
X(s; s, x, y) = x,\\
Y(s; s, x, y) = y.
```

So to compute the advected function at the next time step, 
 - we compute the characteristics' feet $`X(t^n; t^{n+1}, x_i, y_j)`$ and $`Y(t^n; t^{n+1}, x_i, y_j)`$ 
 for each mesh point $`(x_i, y_j)`$ with a time integration method ; 
 - we interpolate the function $f(t = t^n)$ on the characteristics' feet. 
 The property ensures that the interpolation gives the function at the next time step $f(t = t^{n+1})$.



## Time integration methods

There are multiple time integration methods available which are implemented in the ITimeStepper child classes. For example: 
 - Explicit Euler method: Euler; 
 - Crank-Nicolson method: CrankNicolson; 
 - Runge-Kutta 3 method: RK3; 
 - Runge-Kutta 4 method: RK4; 

 
 
We are listing the different schemes for this equation $`\partial_t X (t) = A_x(t, X(t),Y(t))`$. 

We write $X (t) = X (t; s, x, y)$, $X^n = X(t^n)$ and $A^n(X) = A(t^n, X)$ for a time discretisation 
$`\{t^n; t^n > t^{n-1},  \forall n\}_n`$. 

 
### Explicit Euler method

$X^n = X^{n+1} - dt A^{n+1}(X^{n+1})$

- Convergence order : 1.


### Crank-Nicolson method

- Scheme: 
$X^{k+1} = X^{n+1} - \frac{dt}{2} \left( A^{n+1}(X^{n+1}) + A^k(X^k) \right)$ and 
$X^{n+1} = X^{k+1}$ once converged.

- Convergence order : 2. 


### RK3 method

		- $`k_2 =  A{n+1/2} (X^{n+1} - \frac{dt}{2} k_1)`$, 
		- $`k_3 =  A{n+1/2} (X^{n+1} - dt( 2k_2 - k_1))`$.

- Convergence order : 3.

		- $`k_1 =  A^{n+1}(X^{n+1})`$, 
		- $`k_2 =  A^{n+1/2} (X^{n+1} - \frac{dt}{2} k_1)`$, 
		- $`k_3 =  A^{n+1/2} (X^{n+1} - \frac{dt}{2} k_2)`$, 
		- $`k_4 =  A^{n} (X^{n+1} - dt k_3)`$.

- Convergence order : 4.



## Advection domain 

There are two advection domains to consider: 
 - the physical domain;
 - the pseudo-Cartesian domain.

It seems logical to use the **physical domain**, where the studied equation is given, as the advection domain. 

However, we want to solve this equation on a polar grid. So before advecting, we have to 
compute the mesh points in the physical domain using a mapping function $\mathcal{F}$:

```math
\mathcal{F} : (r,\theta)_{i,j} \mapsto  (x,y)_{i,j}.
```


This adds some steps to the advection operator, we now have to compute 
 - the mesh points in the physical domain using $\mathcal{F}$; 
 - the characteristics' feet in the physical domain; 
 - the characteristics' feet in the logical domain (polar grid) using $\mathcal{F}^{-1}$; 
 - then interpolate the advection function at the characteristics' feet in the logical domain. 
 
The third step can be difficult especially if the mapping function $\mathcal{F}$ is not analytically invertible. 
It is not impossible, but the computations can be costly. 


That is why, we introduce the **pseudo-Cartesian domain**. 
We use another mapping function $\mathcal{G}$ such that:

```math
 \mathcal{G} : (r,\theta)_{i,j} \mapsto  (x,y)_{i,j} = (r\cos(\theta), r\sin(\theta))_{i,j}. 
```

Then the four previous steps become
 - calculate the mesh points in the pseudo-Cartesian domain using $\mathcal{G}$; 
 - calculate the advection field $A$ in the pseudo-Cartesian domain using the Jacobian matrix of $(\mathcal{F}\circ\mathcal{G}^{-1})^{-1}$; 
 - calculate the characteristics' feet in the pseudo\_Cartesian domain; 
 - calculate the characteristics' feet in the logical domain (polar grid) using $\mathcal{G}^{-1}$; 
 - interpolate the advection function at the characteristics' feet in the logical domain. 

Here, $\mathcal{G}$ is analytically invertible (we can fix  $\mathcal{G}^{-1}(x = 0, y = 0) = (r = 0, \theta = 0)$) 
and  $`(J_{\mathcal{F}}J_{\mathcal{G}}^{-1})^{-1}`$ is well-defined. The details are given in [Zoni et al. (2019)](#zoni). 


**Remark 1:** if $\mathcal{F}$ is the circular mapping function, then the physical domain and the pseudo-Cartesian domain are the same. 

**Remark 2:** if the mapping function is analytically invertible, it is less costly to advect in the physical domain. 



## Advection Field

In the studied equation, the advection field is given along the physical domain axis: 
```math
\partial_t f + A_x \partial_x f + A_y \partial_y f = 0.
```

The BslAdvectionRTheta operator can take as input the advection field along the physical domain axis or the advection field along the logical domain axis,
```math
A = (A_x, A_y) \quad \text{or} \quad A = (A_r, A_\theta).
```

The advection field can be computed thanks to the AdvectionFieldFinder operator. This operator returns the advection field along the physical domain axes or the advection field along the logical domain axes (see [advection\_field\_rp](./../advection_field/README.md)).

* If the advection field is directly given along the physical domain axes, no treatment is needed in the BslAdvectionRTheta operator. 

* If the advection field is given along the logical domain axes, then we need to compute the advection field along the physical domain axes to advect in the physical domain. 

**In the guiding-centre case**, the advection field is computed from the electric field, 
```math
A = - E \wedge e_z = -\nabla \phi \wedge e_z.
```

In [the documentation for the advection field](./../advection_field/README.md), we show that 
```math
\nabla_{xy} \phi = J \nabla_{r\theta} \phi,
```

with *J* the Jacobian matrix (and the metric tensor $`G = J^TJ = [g_{ij}]_{ij}`$). 

It gives the following relation for the electric field
```math
\begin{bmatrix}
    E_x \\
    E_y \\
\end{bmatrix} 
= 
J
\begin{bmatrix}
    E_r \\
    E_\theta \\
\end{bmatrix}.
```


We deduce that 
```math
\begin{bmatrix}
	A_x \\
	A_y 
\end{bmatrix}
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
	- E_y \\
	E_x 
\end{bmatrix}
= \det(J)
J^{-T}
\begin{bmatrix}
	- E_\theta \\
	E_r
\end{bmatrix}
= \det(J)
J^{-T}
\begin{bmatrix}
	A_r \\
	A_\theta
\end{bmatrix}.
```

So, from the advection field along the logical domain axis, we multiply by $`J^{-1}`$
to get the advection field along the physical domain axis. 


# Unit tests

The test of the advection operator are implemented in the `tests/geometryRTheta/advection_2d_rp/` folder 
([advection\_2d\_rp](./../../../tests/geometryRTheta/advection_2d_rp/README.md)).


It tests: 
 - the 4 time integration methods; 
 - the different mappings and advection domains: 
 	- Circular mapping in the physical domain; 
 	- Czarny mapping in the physical domain; 
 	- Czarny mapping in the pseudo-Cartesian domain; 
 	- Discrete mapping of the Czarny mapping in the pseudo-Cartesian domain. 
 - on 3 different simulations: 
 	- simulation 1: translation of Gaussian function 
 		- $`f_0(x,y) = \exp\left( - \frac{(x- x_0)^2}{2 \sigma_x^2} - \frac{(y- y_0)^2}{2 \sigma_y^2} \right)`$, 
 		- $`A(t, x, y) = (v_x, v_y)`$ . 
 	- simulation 2: rotation of Gaussian function 
 		- $`f_0(x,y) = \exp\left( - \frac{(x- x_0)^2}{2 \sigma_x^2} - \frac{(y- y_0)^2}{2 \sigma_y^2} \right)`$, 
 		- $`A(t, x, y) = J_{\mathcal{F}_{\text{circular}}}(v_r, v_\theta)`$. 
 	- simulation 3: decentred rotation (test given in [Zoni et al. (2019)](#zoni)). 
 	 	- $`f_0(x,y) = \frac{1}{2} \left( G(r_1(x,y)) + G(r_2(x,y))\right)`$,
 	 		- with 
 	 			- $`G(r) = \cos\left(\frac{\pi r}{2 a}\right)^4 * 1_{r<a}(r)`$, 
 	 			- $`r_1(x, y) = \sqrt{(x-x_0)^2 + 8(y-y_0)^2}`$ 
 	 			- $`r_2(x, y) = \sqrt{8(x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2}`$ 
 		- $`A(t, x, y) = \omega(y_c - y, x - x_c)`$. 

The tests of the convergence order are made for constant CFL which means it checks the slope of the errors 
(infinity norm of the difference at the final time)  
for $`(N_r\times N_\theta, dt) = (N_{r,0}\times N_{\theta,0}, dt_0)`$ and then $`(n*N_{r,0}\times n*N_{\theta,0}, dt_0/n)`$
for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8,  ...$.
