/**
 * @brief A class to call all the builders of all the patches once. 
 * 
 * We need to instantiate all the builders for all the pacthes in the main code.
 * We process the same way for the ddc::Chunk containing the spline coefficients and the 
 * values of the function on each patch, and we store them in std::tuple. 
 * This class is instantiated with all the builders. 
 * The operator() allows to call all the builders stored in the member of this class in 
 * one single line. 
 * 
 * This function is useful to avoid calling individually all the builders, especially in 
 * multipatch geometry with several patches. 
 *  
 * @tparam Builders Type of builders for each patch.
