# Multipatch 

The `multipatch` folder contains all the code describing methods and classes which are specific to a multi-patch geometry. It is broken up into the following sub-folders:

- [connectivity](./connectivity/README.md) - Defines structures and methods to describe patches and how they are connected to one another.

- [data\_types](./data_types/README.md) - Defines classes to handle objects on a multi-patch domain more conveniently.

- [spline](./spline/README.md) - Defines structures and methods to deal with different splines on every patch.

- [utils](./utils/README.md) - Defines utility functions to operate over multiple patches.
