This directory defines structures and methods for the sticking of
patches of a multi-patch domain.

## Sticking of Two Edges

We follow the idea to represent the topology of a multipatch domain using
the idea of *domain manifolds* (see [1]). This means that we have several
independent tensor-product logical domains and define their sticking via coordinate 
transformations.


**Remark:** In the referenced paper, the authors use affine isometries of the entire 
patch instead of coordinate transformations of the faces. This is equivalent to our approach in 
the sense that, when the scaling of the domains is removed and we consider only 
unit squares as logical domains, the coordinate transformations of the faces and the information 
about which edges are identified determine the 
isometries used in the paper and vice versa. This is easy to show.

### Multi-patch domain

For simplicity, we will constrain ourselves to the 2D case, but this approach
could be generalized to arbitrary dimensions.

Let $\Omega$ be the domain of interest and assume that we have patches 
$\Omega^{(i)}$, $i=1,...,K$, which are disjoint, s.t.
$$
\Omega = \dot{\bigcup}_{i=1}^K \Omega^{(i)}.
$$
For every patch $\Omega^{(i)}$ we have a mapping 
$$
F^{(i)}: [a_x^{(i)}, b_x^{(i)}]\times[a_y^{(i)} b_y^{(i)}] \rightarrow \Omega^{(i)}, 
$$
where the rectangular domain $`[a_x^{(i)}, b_x^{(i)}]\times[a_y^{(i)} b_y^{(i)}]`$ defines 
the logical coordinates for the patch. We call this logical coordinate domain 
the *logical patch*.

### Edges

So we obtain four logical edges
$$
[a_x^{(i)}, b_x^{(i)}] \times \{ a_y^{(i)} \}, \quad
[a_x^{(i)}, b_x^{(i)}] \times \{ b_y^{(i)} \}, \quad
\{ a_x^{(i)} \} \times [a_y^{(i)}, b_y^{(i)}], \quad
\{ b_x^{(i)} \} \times [a_y^{(i)}, b_y^{(i)}] 
$$

In the code, we define edges as follows. Every edge of a 
logical patch is identified via the patch it belongs to, the dimension 
and whether it is at the front or the back of the domain. So e.g.
the edge $`[a_x^{(i)}, b_x^{(i)}] \times \{ a_y^{(i)} \}`$ would be
identified with patch $i$, dimensions `RDimXi` and `FRONT`.
$`[a_x^{(i)}, b_x^{(i)}] \times \{ b_y^{(i)} \}`$ would be 
identified with patch $i$, dimensions `RDimXi` and `BACK` and 
$`\{ b_x^{(i)} \} \times [a_y^{(i)}, b_y^{(i)}]`$ would be 
identified with patch $i$, dimensions `RDimYi` and `BACK`.

### Sticking and Coordinate Transformation

Any edge can then be identified with an edge on another patch. This corresponds
to the 'sticking'. So for a different patch $`\Omega^{(j)}`$, we have the logical coordinate domain
$`[a_x^{(j)}, b_x^{(j)}] \times [a_y^{(j)} b_y^{(j)}]`$.
If we want to stick patch $i$ to patch $j$, we have to determine the edges that
are identified and how they are identified. The way that they are identified
is mathematically determined via the coordinate transformation from one edge
to the other. Since the transformations are supposed to be affine and bijective, 
there are only two options: The transformation can be order preserving or 
order reversing (this corresponds to the orientation of the phyiscal edge where 
two parametrizations coming from the two patches can have either the same or the 
opposite orientation respectively).

So for example, we want to stick the edge $`\{ a_x^{(i)} \} \times [a_y^{(i)}, b_y^{(i)}]`$
on patch $i$ to the edge $`[a_x^{(j)}, b_x^{(j)}] \times \{ b_y^{(j)} \}`$ on patch 
$j$. If the transformation is order-preserving (i.e. the orientations of the parametrizations 
of the physical edge agree), then the transformation from the first edge to the second is 
$$
t \mapsto a_x^{(j)} + \frac{t - a_y^{(i)}}{b_y^{(i)} - a_y^{(i)}} \, (b_x^{(j)} - a_x^{(j)}).
$$
If the transformation is order-reversing (i.e. the orientations of the parametrizations 
of the physical edge are opposite), then it is
$$
t \mapsto b_x^{(j)} - \frac{t - a_y^{(i)}}{b_y^{(i)} - a_y^{(i)}} \, (b_x^{(j)} - a_x^{(j)}).
$$


In the code, the sticking of two edges is represented by an `Interface` structure
which contains references to 
the first patch and the second patch as well as the boolean member
`orientations_agree`. The transformation from one edge to the other
is done using the 
`EdgeCoordinatesTransformation` operator.
