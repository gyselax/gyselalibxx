 * They can be stored in this class and then be accessed by the patch they are defined
 * on.
 * 
 * @tparam T The type of the objects that are stored on the given patches.
 * @tparam Patches The patches of the objects in the same order of the patches 
 *                 that the given objects are defined on. 
 *         
 * @warning The objects have to be defined on different patches. Otherwise retrieving 
 *          them by their patch is ill-defined.
