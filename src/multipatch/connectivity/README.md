## Patch

The tag Patch refers to a single 2D patch geometry. The tag contains aliases (or shortcuts) to the DDC geometry elements, such as:

- Grids (or points sequence along one dimension) on both dimensions (`Grid1` and `Grid2`);  
- Associated continuous dimensions (`Dim1` and `Dim2`);  
- Dimensions for B-splines coefficients (`Bsplines1` and `Bsplines2`);  
- Coordinates of objects represented on the dimensions (`Coord1`, `Coord2` and `Coord12`);  
- The type which describes the index of a grid point (e.g. `Idx1`);  
- The type which describes a distance between grid points (e.g. `IdxStep1`);
- The type which describes the index range of a grid (e.g. `IdxRange1`).
- The type which describes the index range of a spline coefficients grid (e.g. `BSIdxRange1`).

The domain defined on this patch is called *logical domain*.

## Interfaces

### Sticking of Two Edges

We follow the idea to represent the topology of a multipatch domain using
the idea of *domain manifolds* (see [1]). This means that we have several
independent tensor-product logical domains and define their sticking via coordinate
transformations.

**Remark:** In the referenced paper, the authors use affine isometries of the entire
patch instead of coordinate transformations of the faces. This is equivalent to our approach in
the sense that, when the scaling of the domains is removed and we consider only
unit squares as logical domains, the coordinate transformations of the faces and the information
about which edges are identified determine the
isometries used in the paper and vice versa. This is easy to show.

#### Multi-patch domain

For simplicity, we will constrain ourselves to the 2D case, but this approach
could be generalised to arbitrary dimensions.

Let $\Omega$ be the domain of interest and assume that we have patches $\Omega^{(i)}$, $i=1,...,K$, which are disjoint, s.t.

```math
\Omega = \dot{\bigcup}_{i=1}^K \Omega^{(i)}.
```

For every patch $\Omega^{(i)}$ we have a mapping

```math
F^{(i)}: [a_x^{(i)}, b_x^{(i)}]\times[a_y^{(i)} b_y^{(i)}] \rightarrow \Omega^{(i)}, 
```

where the rectangular domain $`[a_x^{(i)}, b_x^{(i)}]\times[a_y^{(i)} b_y^{(i)}]`$ defines
the logical coordinates for the patch. We call this logical coordinate domain
the *logical patch*.

#### Edges

So we obtain four logical edges

```math
[a_x^{(i)}, b_x^{(i)}] \times \{ a_y^{(i)} \}, \quad
[a_x^{(i)}, b_x^{(i)}] \times \{ b_y^{(i)} \}, \quad
\{ a_x^{(i)} \} \times [a_y^{(i)}, b_y^{(i)}], \quad
\{ b_x^{(i)} \} \times [a_y^{(i)}, b_y^{(i)}] 
```

In the code, we define edges as follows.
Every edge of a logical patch is identified via the patch it belongs to, the dimension
and whether it is at the front or the back of the domain.
So e.g.the edge $`[a_x^{(i)}, b_x^{(i)}] \times \{ a_y^{(i)} \}`$ would be identified with patch $i$, dimensions `Yi` and `FRONT`.
$`[a_x^{(i)}, b_x^{(i)}] \times \{ b_y^{(i)} \}`$ would be identified with patch $i$, dimensions `Yi` and `BACK` and
$`\{ b_x^{(i)} \} \times [a_y^{(i)}, b_y^{(i)}]`$ would be identified with patch $i$, dimensions `Xi` and `BACK`.

#### Sticking and Coordinate Transformation

Any edge can then be associated with an edge on another patch.
This corresponds to the 'sticking'.
So for a different patch $`\Omega^{(j)}`$, we have the logical coordinate domain
$`[a_x^{(j)}, b_x^{(j)}] \times [a_y^{(j)} b_y^{(j)}]`$.
If we want to stick patch $i$ to patch $j$, we have to determine the edges that
are identified and how they are identified.
The way that they are identified is mathematically determined via the coordinate transformation from one edge
to the other.
Since the transformations are supposed to be affine and bijective, there are only two options:
the transformation can be order preserving or
order reversing (this corresponds to the orientation of the physical edge where two parametrisations
coming from the two patches can have either the same or the opposite orientation respectively).

So for example, we want to stick the edge $`\{ a_x^{(i)} \} \times [a_y^{(i)}, b_y^{(i)}]`$
on patch $i$ to the edge $`[a_x^{(j)}, b_x^{(j)}] \times \{ b_y^{(j)} \}`$ on patch $j$.
If the transformation is order-preserving (i.e. the orientations of the parametrisations
of the physical edge agree), then the transformation from the first edge to the second is

```math
t \mapsto a_x^{(j)} + \frac{t - a_y^{(i)}}{b_y^{(i)} - a_y^{(i)}} \, (b_x^{(j)} - a_x^{(j)}).
```

If the transformation is order-reversing (i.e. the orientations of the parametrisations
of the physical edge are opposite), then it is

```math
t \mapsto b_x^{(j)} - \frac{t - a_y^{(i)}}{b_y^{(i)} - a_y^{(i)}} \, (b_x^{(j)} - a_x^{(j)}).
```

In the code, an edge is represented by the `Edge` structure.
The sticking of two edges is represented by an `Interface` structure which contains tags
to the first patch and the second patch as well as the boolean member `orientations_agree`.
The transformation from one edge to the other is done using the `EdgeTransformation` operator.

This operator contains an `operator()` to transform a given coordinate on a coordinate on the other patch.
It has also been extended for indices.

#### Index transformation

All the patches are discretized into a finite number of points indexed by indices.
So each index refers to a coordinate on a patch.
For a given index on an edge of a patch at the interface, we can find an equivalent
index on the other patch. This is always true for conforming meshes but not always the
case for non-conforming meshes.

For non-conforming meshes, the method `is_match_available()` is needed to identify if the given
index has an equivalent or not. If `is_match_available()` returns true, we can then
call the `operator()` to get the equivalent index on the other patch.
Instead of calling both method, it is also possible to call `search_for_match()` which
returns true if there is an equivalent index and updates it the given target index.

**For uniform grids** $`\{x_i\}_{i=0, ..., N}`$ (current grid)  and $`\{x_j\}_{j=0, ..., M}`$ (target grid),
finding an equivalent index can be done with the following steps:

- We compute the greatest common divisor of the number of cells $`N`$ and $`M`$
(e.g. $`\exists \ gcd \in\mathbb{N}, gcd>1; \ M \wedge N = gcd`$).

- The current index $`k`$ can have an equivalent index on the target patch.

Depending on if $`k / p \in \mathbb{N}^*`$ with $`p = \frac{N}{gcd} \in \mathbb{N}^*`$,
this equivalent is given by multiplying by $`\frac{M}{N}`$ and adapt if the coordinate transformation is not order-preserving.

- If the greatest common divisor is $`1`$, there is no equivalent index except for the first and last indices.

**For non-uniform grids**, we cannot use this algorithm. We check all the indices of the target patch if
one of them fit with the current one.
We can use dichotomy method for the search.

#### Conformity of the meshes

When there are non-conforming meshes, some operators need to loop on the "conforming indexes" at each Interface,
i.e. the indexes with an equivalent index on the other patch of the interface.

The `UniformIdxStepIndexMatching` storage class stores for a given Interface the "conforming indexes" in an IdxRangeSlice for each patch.
Currently, the IdxRangeSlice stores indexes from an IdxRange with regular index steps.
So the `UniformIdxStepIndexMatching` class does the same, and triggers assert when the conformity between two edges is not
uniform.

For example, `UniformIdxStepIndexMatching` is adapted to this type of interface

```none
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8       <- Edge1
    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
       -2-     -2-     -2-     -2-          <- The index steps are regular. 
       -1-     -1-     -1-     -1-          <- The index steps are regular. 
    |       |       |       |       |
    0       1       2       3       4       <- Edge2
```

but fails for this type of interface

```none
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8       <- Edge1
    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
     -1-     -3-       -2-     -2-          <- The index steps are NOT regular. 
     -1-     -1-       -1-     -1-          <- The index steps are regular. 
    |   |           |       |       |
    0   1           2       3       4       <- Edge2
```

The grids can be uniform or not uniform, as long as the index steps between the conforming indices are regular.

If the grids are uniform, we know that the index steps between the conforming indices are regular.
Moreover the index steps are given by the number of cells divided by the greatest common divisor of the
two numbers of cells.
(E.g. if the first example was on uniform grids: $`\gcd(8,4) = 4`$. On the first edge, the index step is $`\frac{8}{4} = 2`$ and
on the second edge, $`\frac{4}{4} = 1`$.)

## Patch locator

The patch locator operators identify the patch where a given physical coordinate is.

### Mappings

On each patch, we define a mapping from the logical domain to the physical domain.

```math
    \mathcal{F}^{(i)}: \hat{\Omega}^{(i)} \rightarrow \Omega^{(i)}
```

(The $`\hat{\Omega}^{(i)}`$ refers to the above domain $`[a_x^{(i)}, b_x^{(i)}]\times[a_y^{(i)}, b_y^{(i)}]`$.)
The domain $`\hat{\Omega}^{(i)}`$  is called the *logical domain* and $`\Omega^{(i)}`$ the *physical domain*.

### Global analytical invertible mapping

We assume that there is a global mapping analytically invertible such that

```math
    \mathcal{F}: \hat{\Omega} \rightarrow \Omega \\
    (\mathcal{F})^{-1}: \Omega \rightarrow \hat{\Omega} \\
        \text{with } \Omega = \bigcup_{i = 0}^{K} \Omega^{(i)} \quad 
        \text{and } \hat{\Omega} = \bigcup_{i = 0}^{K} \hat{\Omega}^{(i)} .\\
```

We can easily apply $`(\mathcal{F})^{-1}`$ to identify the equivalent logical coordinate of a given physical coordinate $`x\in\Omega`$.
We check then for each patch if the logical coordinate is on a rectangular logical patch $\hat{\Omega}^{(i)}$,
i.e. if $`(\mathcal{F})^{-1}(x)\in\hat{\Omega}^{(i)}`$.

#### Onion shape geometry

We call "onion" shape geometry a disk-like patch surrounded by concentric ring-like patches.
The patches are defined on the same dimensions `R` and `Theta`.
The logical grid is then split into different logical grids, one for each patch.
We can then define one global mapping from the (`R`, `Theta`) domain to the (`X`, `Y`) domain for all the patches.
This mapping also needs to be defined from the physical domain to the logical domain.

We order the patches from the O-point to the outside boundary.

The patch grids have to be continuous (i.e. we define patches such as $`b_x^{(i)} = a_x^{(i+1)}`$ for
edges on $`\{a_x^{(i)}\}\times[a_y^{(i)}, b_y^{(i)}]`$ and $`\{b_x^{(i+1)}\}\times[a_y^{(i+1)}, b_y^{(i+1)}]`$).

In the `OnionPatchLocator` operator, we use these properties to apply a dichotomy method
and reduce the number of tests to identify where the physical coordinate is.
