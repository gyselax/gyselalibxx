# GeometryVparMu : 

The geometry folder contains a helper file `geometry.hpp` which provides shortcuts to the types needed to define the 2D velocity geometry (vpar,mu).
- Concerning the 3D space, several coordinate systems are used:
  * Vpar : the parallel velocity 
  * Mu : the magnetic momentum (i.e \(\mu = \frac{v_{\perp}^2}{2B}\))
  * V2D = (Vpar, Mu)
