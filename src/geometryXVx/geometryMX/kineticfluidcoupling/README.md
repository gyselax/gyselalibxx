# Kinetic fluid coupling (MX)

The `kineticfluidcoupling` folder contains code that allows for the coupling between the fluid equation of neutrals and the kinetic Boltzmann equation of plasma particles. This link is made adding two source terms that introduce or remove particles from both systems in identical and opposite quantities.

The currently implemented coupler is :
