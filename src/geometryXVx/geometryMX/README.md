# Geometry (x)

The `geometryMX` folder contains all the code describing methods which are specific to a geometry with 1 spatial dimension and one dimension describing fluid moments (ex: density, temperature, mean velocity). It is broken up into the following sub-folders:

- [fluidinitialization](./fluidinitialization/README.md) : Initialization methods for fluid species. 
- [fluidtransportsolver](./fluidtransportsolver/README.md) : Solver for fluid models transport.
- [kineticfluidcoupling](./kineticfluidcoupling/README.md) : Solver for sources in fluid and kinetic equations. 
- [reactionrates](./reactionrates/README.md) : Reaction rate calculations.
