# Geometry X-Vx

The geometry folder contains a helper file `geometry.hpp` which provides shortcuts to the types needed to define the specific geometry. In this case the geometry is a simulation with 1 spatial dimension (denoted X) and 1 velocity dimension (denoted Vx).

The shortcuts defined in the geometry file represent:
1.  The spatial, velocity and time dimensions in real space (RDimX, RDimVx, and RDimT).
2.  The type of coordinates of objects represented on the dimensions (CoordT, CoordX, CoordVx, CoordXVx).
3.  The type of the B-Spline bases used on the spatial and velocity dimensions (BSplinesX, BSplinesVx).
4.  The type which will describe the grid points (representing space, velocity and species) on which the simulation will evolve (IDimX, IDimVx, IDimSp).
5.  The type of the helper class which initialises grid points in space and velocity which are compatible with the defined splines (SplineInterpPointsX, SplineInterpPointsVx).
6.  The type of the objects used to build splines (SplineXBuilder, SplineVxBuilder).
7.  The type which describes the index of a grid point (representing space, velocity and/or species) (e.g. IndexX).
8.  The type which describes a distance between grid points (e.g. IVectX).
9.  The type which describes the domain on which the grid points are defined (e.g. IDomainX).
10. The templated type of a field defined on each of the domains (e.g. FieldX<ElementType>). A field defines values at each grid point in the provided domain.
11. The type of a field of doubles defined on each of the domains (e.g. DFieldX).
12. The templated type of a field span defined on each of the domains (e.g. SpanX<ElementType>). A span is similar to a reference. It provides access to a field or a sub-set of a field, but does not own the data itself.
13. The type of a span of doubles defined on each of the domains (e.g. DSpanX).
12. The templated type of a field view defined on each of the domains (e.g. ViewX<ElementType>). A view is very similar to a span. The only difference is that a view is constant. In other words, the data in the underlying field cannot be modified using a view.
13. The type of a view of doubles defined on each of the domains (e.g. DViewX).
15. Types representing coordinates, and the grid points as well as their indices, distances and domains for the Fourier mode.
16. A class GeometryXVx detailing some of the above types in a generic way which allows them to be accessed from a context where the final geometry selected is unknown.
