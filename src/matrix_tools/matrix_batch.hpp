 * @brief MatrixBatch superclass for managing a collection of linear systems. 
 * The main assumption is that all matrices have the same size.
 * It is also assumed that each matrix is used to solve one equation.
 * 
 * Classes inheriting from this class must manage other aspects:
 * Sparsity: kind of storage (Dense, Ell, Csr, etc.)
 * Kind of solver (direct, iterative)
 * Preconditioners and factorisations
 *
 * @tparam ExecSpace Execution space,needed by Kokkos for allocations and parallelism.
 * The simplest choice is to follow Kokkos, for that: specify Kokkos::DefaultExecutionSpace
