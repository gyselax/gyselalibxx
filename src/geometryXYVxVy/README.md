# Geometry (x, y, v\_x, v\_y)

The `geometryXYVxVy` folder contains all the code describing methods which are specific to a geometry with 2 spatial dimensions and 2 velocity dimensions. It is broken up into the following sub-folders:

- [geometry](./geometry/README.md) - All the dimension tags used for a simulation in the geometry.
- [initialisation](./initialisation/README.md) - Code describing initialisation of the distribution and equilibrium functions.
- [poisson](./poisson/README.md) - Code describing the Quasi-Neutrality solver.
- [time\_integration](./time_integration/README.md) - Time integrators for a Boltzmann-Poisson system of equations.
- [vlasov](./vlasov/README.md) - Code describing solvers for the Vlasov equation.
