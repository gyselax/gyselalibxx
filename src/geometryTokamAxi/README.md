# Geometry (mu, vpar, r, theta)

The `geometryTokamAxi` folder contains all the code describing methods which are specific to a geometry with the 2 spatial dimensions (r,theta) and the 2 velocity dimensions (vpar,mu). It is broken up into the following sub-folders:

- [geometry](./geometry/README.md) : All the dimension tags used for a simulation in the geometry.

- [initialization](./initialization/README.md) : Methods related to the initialisation of the TokamAxi geometry.
