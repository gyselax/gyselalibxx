# Geometry (x, y)

The `geometryXY` folder contains all the code describing methods which are specific to a geometry with 2 spatial dimensions. It is broken up into the following sub-folders:

- [geometry](./geometry/README.md) : All the dimension tags used for a simulation in the geometry.
- [initialisation](./initialisation/README.md) : Initialisation methods for the distribution function.
- [time\_integration](./time_integration/README.md) : Time integrators for system of equations.
