# Geometry (mu, vpar, r, theta, phi)

The `geometry5D` folder contains all the code describing methods which are specific to a geometry with 3 spatial dimension and 2 velocity dimensions. It is broken up into the following sub-folders:

- [geometry](./geometry/README.md) : All the dimension tags used for a simulation in the geometry.
<!-- - [rhs](./rhs/README.md) : Code describing the operators on the right hand side of the Boltzmann equation; namely sources, sinks and collisions.-->
