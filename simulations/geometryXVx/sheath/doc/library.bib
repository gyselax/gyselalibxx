Unlike the core, the plasma edge and scrape-off layer are characterized by lower temperature and higher collisionality. To allow for realistic gyrokinetic modelling of edge and scrape-off layer turbulence, it is crucial to include collisional effects into the simulations. In this work, we present a full-f, gyro-averaged, multi-species, Lenard-Bernstein/Dougherty (LBD) collision operator, for the use in the gyrokinetic turbulence code GENE-X. The operator accounts for exact particle density, momentum, and energy conservation, with collision frequencies chosen such that the momentum or temperature relaxation rates of the Boltzmann collision operator are recovered. We provide a conservative second-order finite-volume implementation of the operator and present a thorough verification. Due to the excellent conservation properties of the finite-volume implementation, it is possible to use a coarser velocity space grid, save computational resources and, as a consequence, perform simulations of larger fusion devices.},

Some of the recent breakthroughs of three such codes, namely GYSELA, ORB5 and XGC1, are reported and compared wherever appropriate. In all three codes, turbulent transport appears to be mediated by avalanche-like events, for a broad range of $\rho$* = $\rho$i/a values, ratio of the gyro-radius over the minor radius. Still, the radial correlation length scales with $\rho$i, leading to the gyro-Bohm scaling of the effective transport coefficient below $\rho$* ? 1/300. The possible explanation could be due to the fact that avalanches remain meso-scale due to the interaction with zonal flows, whose characteristic radial wavelength appears to be almost independent of the system size. As a result of the radial corrugation of the turbulence driven zonal and mean flows, the shear of the radial electric field can be significantly underestimated if poloidal rotation is assumed to be governed by the neoclassical theory, especially at low collisionality. Indeed, the turbulence contribution to the poloidal rotation increases when collisionality decreases. Finally, the numerical verification of toroidal momentum balance shows that both neoclassical and turbulent contributions to the Reynolds' stress tensor play the dominant role. The phase space analysis further reveals that barely passing supra-thermal particles mostly contribute to the toroidal flow generation, consistently with quasi-linear predictions.},

Bohm's criterion expresses a necessary condition for the formation of a stationary sheath in front of a negative absorbing wall. The basic features of the plasma-sheath transition and their relation to the Bohm criterion are discussed and illustrated from a simple cold-ion fluid model. A rigorous kinetic analysis of the vicinity of the sheath edge allows one to generalize Bohm's criterion accounting not only for arbitrary ion and electron distributions, but also for general boundary conditions at the wall. It is shown that the generalized sheath condition is (apart from special exceptions) marginally fulfilled and related to a sheath edge field singularity. Due to this singularity, smooth matching of the presheath and sheath solutions requires an additional transition layer. Previous investigations concerning particular problems of the plasma-sheath transition are reviewed in the light of the general relations.},

	abstract = {The input power requirements for accessing H-mode at low density and maintaining it during the density ramp in ITER is addressed by statistical means applied to the international H-mode threshold power database. Following the recent addition of new data, the improvement of existing data and the improvement of selection criteria, a revised scaling law that describes the threshold power required to obtain an L-mode to H-mode transition is presented. Predictions for ITER give a threshold power of \~{}52MW in a deuterium plasma at a line average density, ne = 0.5{\texttimes}1020m-3. At the nominal ITER H-mode density, ne = 1.0{\texttimes}1020m-3, the threshold power required is \~{}86MW. Detailed analysis of data from individual devices suggests that the density dependence of the threshold power might increase with the plasma size and the magnetic field. On the other hand, the density at which the threshold power is minimal is found to decrease with the plasma size and increase with magnetic field. The influence of these effects on the accessibility of the H-mode regime in ITER plasmas is discussed. Analyses of the confinement database show that, in present day devices, H-modes are generally maintained with powers exceeding the threshold power by a factor larger than 1.5, and that, on the other hand, good confinement can be obtained close to the threshold power although rarely demonstrated.},

We refer to this technique as the logical sheath boundary condition. This boundary condition, when incorporated into a direct-implicit particle code, permits large space- and time-scale simulations of bounded systems, which would otherwise be impractical on current supercomputers. The lack of resolution of the collector sheath potential drop obtained from conventional implicit simulations at moderate values of $\omega$pe $\Delta$t and $\Delta$ z/ $\lambda$De provides the motivation for the development of the logical sheath boundary condition. The algorithm for use of the logical sheath boundary condition in a particle simulation is presented. Results from simulations which use the logical sheath boundary condition are shown to compare reasonably well with those from an analytic theory and simulations in which the sheath is resolved.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces the concept of plasma-wall self-organization (PWSO) in magnetic fusion. The basic idea is the existence of a time delay in the feedback loop relating radiation and impurity production on divertor plates. Both a zero and a one-dimensional description of PWSO are provided. They lead to an iterative equation whose equilibrium fixed point~is unstable above some threshold. This threshold corresponds to a radiative density limit, which can be reached for a ratio of total radiated power to total input power as low as 1/2. When detachment develops and physical sputtering dominates, this limit is progressively pushed to very high values if the radiation of non-plate impurities stays low. Therefore, PWSO comes with two basins for this organization: the usual one with a density limit, and a new one with density freedom, in particular for machines using high-Z materials. Two basins of attraction of PWSO are shown to exist for the tokamak during start-up, with a high density one leading to this freedom. This basin~might be reached by a proper tailoring of ECRH assisted ohmic start-up in present middle-size tokamaks, mimicking present stellarator start-up. In view of the impressive tokamak DEMO wall load challenge, it is worth considering and checking this possibility, which comes with that of more margins for ITER and of smaller reactors.},

An analytical expression is derived to describe the initial transient of the density, particle flux and energy profiles, induced by the ballistic propagation of the cold front in phase space(x, v). The same propagation is recovered in the global gyrokinetic code on the distribution function along the poloidal direction.

	abstract = {The H-mode is a confinement mode of toroidal plasmas, which may make the goals of fusion possible{\textemdash}the development of a clean energy source at competitive electricity costs. The most challenging aspect of the H-mode physics is the sudden disappearance of the edge turbulence whereas its driving forces{\textemdash}the gradients{\textemdash}increase. As the physics behind the H-mode is subtle many features are not yet clarified. There is, however, substantial experimental and theoretical evidence that turbulent flows, which normally limit the confinement, are diminished by sheared poloidal flow residing at the plasma edge. There are many conceivable mechanisms giving rise to sheared flow. The most intriguing of these is that fluctuations themselves induce the flow, which acts back to its generating origin and annihilates the turbulence. This review concentrates mostly on the transition physics, describes one line of understanding the H-mode in more detail, recalls some of the older observations and summarizes the achievements in the H-mode for both tokamaks and stellarators.},

	abstract = {An analytic solution for the expansion of a plasma into vacuum is assessed for its relevance to the parallel transport of edge localized mode (ELM) filaments along field lines. This solution solves the 1D1V Vlasov{\textendash}Poisson equations for the adiabatic (instantaneous source), collisionless expansion of a Gaussian plasma bunch into an infinite space in the quasineutral limit. The quasineutral assumption is found to hold as long as $\lambda$D0/$\sigma$0 ? 0.01 (where $\lambda$D0 is the initial Debye length at peak density and $\sigma$0 is the parallel length of the Gaussian filament), a condition that is physically realistic. The inclusion of a boundary at x = L and consequent formation of a target sheath is found to have a negligible effect when L/$\sigma$0 ? 5, a condition that is physically plausible. Under the same condition, the target flux densities predicted by the analytic solution are well approximated by the {\textquoteleft}free-streaming{\textquoteright} equations used in previous experimental studies, strengthening the notion that these simple equations are physically reasonable. Importantly, the analytic solution predicts a zero heat flux density so that a fluid approach to the problem can be used equally well, at least when the source is instantaneous. It is found that, even for JET-like pedestal parameters, collisions can affect the expansion dynamics via electron temperature isotropization, although this is probably a secondary effect. Finally, the effect of a finite duration, $\tau$src, for the plasma source is investigated. As is found for an instantaneous source, when L/$\sigma$0 ? 5 the presence of a target sheath has a negligible effect, at least up to the explored range of $\tau$src = L/cs (where cs is the sound speed at the initial temperature).},

Simple expressions are obtained for the mean velocity and the mean square velocity of the ions, and for the wall potential with respect to the plasma. The conditions for the formation of a stable plasma-sheath boundary are briefly examined and a general criterion is obtained without considering any specific mechanism of ion transport. No assumptions are made regarding the energy distribution of the ions, and the result is therefore a refinement on Bohm's original criterion which was derived by assuming a monoenergetic ion flux. With the aid of the criterion developed in the present treatment conclusions are then drawn in the case of the collision-free model regarding conditions applying at the plasma boundary. The experimental results are found to be consistent with these theoretical conditions.},

	abstract = {The Langmuir probe technique is not suitable for measuring ion densities above 1 mm Hg pressure because the probe dimensions approach those of the ionic and electronic mean free paths. In addition to the invalidity of the Langmuir theory for this case, such a probe also causes a great disturbance of the discharge. In this paper a detailed examination is made of the possibility of using a probe collecting positive ions as a means of finding ion densities It has been found possible to calculate the potential distribution, outside a space-charge sheath around a spherical probe, if the radius of the sheath is known From this the current of positive ions to the probe may be found Curves are given to facilitate this calculation. It is found that, depending on the ion concentration and pressure, there are two rather different sets of conditions around the probe. If the ion density is high (greater than about 108/mean free path (in cm)) a thin sheath will form on the probe and a complete solution of the problem is possible Under such conditions the energies of the diffusing ions in the neighbourhood of the probe greatly exceed the thermal energies of the gas particles At the lower ion densities normally encountered, a thick `diffusion' sheath occurs and the problem can now only be solved if the sheath thickness is known The ion energies may or may not greatly exceed the thermal energies, depending on conditions. These results contradict one of the basic assumptions made by Davydov and Zmanovskaja in their approach to the same problem They assume a thin sheath with the ions in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding gas As a result their conclusion is in conflict with the conclusion of this paper, that in most circumstances it is not possible to use a negative probe to measure ion densities unless an additional means of determining the sheath thickness is available.},

This is especially important for steady state operation, where thermal loads on all the plasma facing components, even remote from the plasma, are of interest. Moreover, main chamber tungsten sources are thought to dominate the contamination of the plasma core. We present here in particular new developments aimed at improving the description of the interface between the plasma and the wall, namely a way to treat sheath physics in a more faithful way using the output of 1D particle in cell simulations. Moreover, different models for prompt redeposition have been implemented and are compared. The latter is shown to play an important role in the balance between divertor and main chamber sources.},

Advanced experimental scenarios exploit the fascinating yet uncommon ability of confined plasmas to bifurcate into states of enhanced performance upon application of additional free energy sources. Self-regulation of small-scale turbulent eddies is essential to accessing these improved regimes. However, after several decades, basic principles for these bifurcations are still largely debated and clarifications from first principles lacking. We show here, computed from the primitive kinetic equations, establishment of a state of improved confinement through self-organisation of plasma microturbulence. Our results highlight the critical role of the interface between plasma and material boundaries and demonstrate the importance of propagation of turbulence activity beyond regions of convective drive. These observations strongly suggest a paradigm shift where the magnetised plasma at the onset of enhanced performance self-organises into a globally critical state, {\textquoteleft}nonlocally{\textquoteright} controlled by fluxes of turbulence activity.},

The flux-driven simulation is performed until an approximate power balance is achieved between the heat-flux across the steep pedestal pressure gradient and the heat-flux on the divertor plates. The simulation results compare well against the empirical scaling $\lambda$ q 1/ obtained from present tokamak devices, where $\lambda$ q is the divertor heat-flux width mapped to the outboard midplane, $\gamma$  =  1.19 as found by Eich et al (2013 Nucl.

This empirical scaling predicts $\lambda$ q  ?  1 mm when extrapolated to ITER, which would require operation with very high separatrix densities (n sep/n Greenwald  {\textgreater}  0.6) (Kukushkin et al 2013 J.

Using the same simulation code and technique, however, the projected $\lambda$ q for ITER{\textquoteright}s model plasma is 5.9 mm, which could be suggesting that operation in the ITER Q  =  10 scenario with acceptable divertor power loads may be obtained over a wider range of plasma separatrix densities and radiative fractions. The physics reason behind this difference is, according to the XGC1 results, that while the ion magnetic drift contribution to the divertor heat-flux width is wider in the present tokamaks, the turbulent electron contribution is wider in ITER. Study will continue to verify further this important projection. A high current C-Mod discharge is found to be in a mixed regime: While the heat-flux width by the ion neoclassical magnetic drift is still wider than the turbulent electron heat-flux width, the heat-flux magnitude is dominated by the narrower electron heat-flux.},
