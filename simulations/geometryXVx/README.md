# Simulations in (x, vx) geometry

This folder constains the following simulations: 

- [sheath](./sheath/README.md) - A Boltzmann-Poisson system is solved for the electric field and the distribution function for both electrons and ions species.
- [neutrals](./neutrals/README.md) - Executables for the study of plasma-neutral interactions on a single magnetic field line.
